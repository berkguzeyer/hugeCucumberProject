1) What is JDBC? (JAVA DATABASE CONNECTION)
- It is a library that I can use to automate database tests. It stands for `JAVA DATABASE CONNECTION`.

2) How do you use it?
- I create a connection to the database by using URL, username and password. Then I send my queries and get the results and compare them with the UI.
